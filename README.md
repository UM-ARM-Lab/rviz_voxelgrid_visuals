# Visualization Tools for Voxelgrids in RViz

This RViz plugin and associated tools enable easy viewing of Voxelgrids in RViz. 

You can:
1. change the scale, origin, and frame 
1. change the color, and opacity (alpha) directly from RViz without needing to republish or edit code
1. view data as binary or with independent alpha per voxel, again without needing to republish
1. hide/show the voxelgrid from RViz without needing to republish
